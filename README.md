### Requirements

To run this program the minum you need is a cli (command line interface)  
If you will run it on a Linux system (like myself), you need to make it executable by running on terminal: `sudo chmod a+x main.py`

### How to use

Execute `main.py` on cli and pass the hand you wish to apply as arguments: `python3 main.py 5c 6C 7d 8C 9c`

Upon execution, all unit tests will be run and the output will be as follows:

`All unit tests passed! 
**HAND*** ['5c', '6C', '7d', '8C', '9c'] 
Straight` 

Have fun and good luck with the best hand!
